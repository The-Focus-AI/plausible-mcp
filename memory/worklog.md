## Mon Mar 31 06:54:56 EDT 2025 - Environment Variable Management Transition

### Summary
Started transition from dotenv-based environment variable management to exclusive use of 1Password for secret management.

### Accomplishments
- Removed dotenv package from project dependencies
- Identified all files containing environment variable and .env references:
  - server.ts: dotenv configuration and imports
  - cli.ts: OpenAI API key handling
  - apiLogger.ts: Debug flag management
  - tests/apiLogger.test.ts: Environment variable testing
  - Documentation files (.gitignore, README.md)

### Decisions
1. Exclusive use of 1Password for secret management to simplify configuration
2. Remove all .env file dependencies to reduce setup complexity
3. Maintain existing error handling and validation patterns during transition

### Next Actions
- Update server.ts to remove dotenv
- Modify other files to use 1Password
- Update tests and documentation

## 2024-03-31 Traffic Analytics Test Issues
**Status**: In Progress
**Summary**: Working on fixing type safety issues in traffic analytics tests

### Accomplishments
- Identified type safety issues in `findLastTrafficToolCall` helper function
- Documented current test failures and their causes
- Started planning proper TypeScript interfaces for tool calls and results

### Decisions
- Helper function needs to be rewritten with proper TypeScript types
- Need to maintain compatibility with both tool names ('get_traffic' and 'mcp_plausible_mcp_get_breakdown')
- Will add proper null checks and error handling

### Next Steps
- Define TypeScript interfaces for tool calls and results
- Update helper function with proper type annotations
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Re-run tests to verify fixes
