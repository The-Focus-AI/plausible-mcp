# Project Plan: Plausible Analytics MCP Integration

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current Phase)

- [x] Set up basic MCP server
- [x] Implement API key management (env + 1Password)
- [x] Create basic API client with TypeScript and Zod
- [x] Implement list_sites command
- [x] Implement get_breakdown command with basic functionality

## Phase 2: Natural Language Processing

- [ ] Design natural language query patterns
- [ ] Implement query parser for common analytics questions
- [ ] Create mapping layer between natural language and API parameters
- [ ] Add support for:
  - [ ] Traffic source queries
  - [ ] Geographic data queries
  - [ ] Page view and visitor metrics
  - [ ] Basic time-based queries

## Phase 3: Error Handling and Validation

- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add detailed error messages for all failure cases
- [ ] Create validation layer for query parameters
- [ ] Add request/response logging
- [ ] Implement rate limit detection and reporting

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Write unit tests for query parsing
- [ ] Create integration tests for API communication
- [ ] Document supported query patterns
- [ ] Add example queries and responses
- [ ] Create user guide for natural language queries

## Phase 5: Optimization and Enhancement

- [ ] Optimize query parsing performance
- [ ] Improve response formatting
- [ ] Add support for more complex queries
- [ ] Implement query validation improvements
- [ ] Add additional analytics dimensions support

## Current Status

- Basic MCP server is operational
- Core API integration is complete
- Authentication methods are working
- Basic query support is implemented
- Natural language processing needs to be implemented

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 2 with natural language query pattern design
2. Create test cases for common analytics questions
3. Implement query parser for basic analytics questions
4. Add support for traffic source queries
