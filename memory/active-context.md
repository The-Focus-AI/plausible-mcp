# Active Context - Mon Mar 31 06:54:56 EDT 2025

## Current Focus
Removing environment variable dependencies and transitioning fully to 1Password for secret management.

## What's Being Worked On
- Removing dotenv package and all related code
- Ensuring 1Password integration handles all secret management
- Maintaining existing functionality while removing .env dependencies

## Current Status
- Successfully removed dotenv package
- Identified references to dotenv and .env files across the codebase
- Need to update multiple files to remove environment variable usage:
  - src/server.ts
  - src/cli.ts
  - src/utils/apiLogger.ts
  - tests/apiLogger.test.ts
- The traffic analytics tests are currently failing due to type issues in the `findLastTrafficToolCall` helper function. The main issues are:
  1. Type safety issues with accessing properties on untyped objects
  2. Spread operator usage on potentially undefined objects
  3. Property access on 'never' typed objects

## Next Steps
1. Update server.ts to remove dotenv configuration
2. Modify cli.ts to use 1Password exclusively
3. Update apiLogger.ts to handle debug flags without environment variables
4. Update tests to reflect new configuration approach
5. Update documentation to remove .env references
6. Define proper TypeScript interfaces for tool calls and results
7. Update the helper function with proper type annotations
8. Add null checks and error handling
9. Re-run tests to verify fixes

## Blockers
- Need to properly type the tool call and tool result objects
- Need to handle potential undefined cases more robustly

## Recent Decisions
- Decision to use 1Password exclusively for secret management
- Removal of dotenv package to simplify dependency management
- Commitment to maintain existing robust error handling during transition
- Identified that the helper function needs to be rewritten with proper TypeScript types
- Current implementation is too permissive with types and needs stricter type checking
- Need to ensure compatibility with both 'get_traffic' and 'mcp_plausible_mcp_get_breakdown' tool names

## Active Decisions

### Testing Strategy

✅ Unit tests complete with 100% coverage
✅ Integration tests verified
✅ Error handling confirmed
✅ Pagination functionality tested
[-] Documentation in progress

### Implementation Approach

- Maintain high test coverage
- Focus on user documentation
- Improve response formatting
- Add more real-world examples

## Current Chunk

Documentation and Enhancement:

1. Testing documentation
2. Response formatting standardization
3. Rate limiting documentation
4. Troubleshooting guide creation

## Progress Through Project Plan

- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): ✅ Complete
- Phase 2 (Tool Enhancement): [-] In Progress
- Phase 3 (Error Handling): ✅ Complete
- Phase 4 (Testing): [-] In Progress
  - Unit tests ✅
  - Integration tests ✅
  - Documentation [-]
  - Example queries ✅
  - User guide [-]

## Known Issues

- Response formatting needs standardization
- Rate limiting documentation pending
- Need more complex query examples
- Documentation organization needs improvement

## Immediate Tasks

1. Create testing documentation
2. Document rate limiting behavior
3. Standardize response formatting
4. Create troubleshooting guide
5. Add more specialized examples
6. Update user guide with test cases

## Implementation Notes
The tests are validating:
1. Traffic source analysis
2. Daily traffic trends
3. Filtered traffic analysis (US traffic)
4. Default traffic query handling

Each test verifies both the natural language processing and the correct tool parameter construction.
